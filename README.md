# Log:Selective

### Perl module for selective logging to the console

Log::Selective is a way for commandline programs to display status messages. The level of verbosity can be controlled without having to change the program's code. Messages at different levels of verbosity can have different colors and styles applied. The module also allows extra verbosity for specific functions or methods.

Some additional functions are also provided. A summary of all warnings or errors that were encountered can be displayed. Stack traces can been shown either on demand or whenever there are warnings or errors.

See the [project's wiki](https://github.com/Alex-Kent/Log-Selective/wiki) 
for full details and documentation.
