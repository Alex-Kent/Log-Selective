# Log:Selective

### Perl module for selective logging to the console

This module is a logger with adjustable verbosity for commandline programs. 
Different verbosity levels can have different colors and styles applied and 
specific functions or methods can get extra verbosity.

Additional functions are provided for displaying summaries of all warnings or 
errors encountered. Stack traces can been shown on demand or whenever there are 
warnings or errors.

See the [project's wiki](https://github.com/Alex-Kent/Log-Selective/wiki) 
for full details and documentation.
